    <h1> This is Sparta! 300 </h1>

    <h2>
        Although this rather embellished retelling of King Leonidas.
    </h2>

    <p>
        The 300 Spartans might not be what some consider
        to be red carpet royalty, the entire, bloody, glorious message of the film can be summed up in three little
        words screamed by the movie's leading monarch.
        "This is Sparta!" with this iconic phrase, a new battle cry and a
        veritable host of memes to come sprung forth like the blood from the Spartan's Persian enemies.

        Part comic book movie, part historical drama, part action film, all guts, glory, and an epic sensation many
        mythic films can only hope to achieve. Historically accurate it might not be, but 300's presentation of the
        Battle of Thermopylae is one that stands toe-to-toe with the likes of Clash of the Titans and Jason and the
        Argonauts.
